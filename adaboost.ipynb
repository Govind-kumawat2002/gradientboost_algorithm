    "The AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) algorithm is an ensemble learning method used primarily for classification problems. It builds a strong classifier by combining multiple weak classifiers, typically decision trees (stumps), in a sequential manner. The primary idea is to focus more on the instances that were misclassified by previous classifiers and improve their predictions in subsequent iterations.\n",

    "* Key Steps in the AdaBoost Algorithm:\n",
    "Initialize Weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign equal weights to all training samples.\n",

    "\n",
    "Train a weak classifier (e.g., a decision stump) on the weighted dataset.\n",
    "Calculate the error rate of the weak classifier.\n",
    "Update Classifier Weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign a weight to the weak classifier based on its error rate. Classifiers with lower errors get higher weights, making them more influential in the final prediction.\n",
    "Update Data Weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increase the weights of misclassified samples so that they get more focus in the next iteration.\n",
    "Normalize the weights to maintain a valid probability distribution.\n",
    "Combine Weak Classifiers:\n",

    "* Aggregate the predictions of all weak classifiers, weighted by their importance, to make the final decision.\n",
